  - Searching for notes, meetings transcripts, or other type of knowledge questions.

# doc-search

The full notes are stored in markdown files in: ~/Documents/notes

The notes are also indexed in a vector database that can be queried using the `mdvectorsearch` to get similar notes back with a similarity score.

Based on the user requests creata a query string and search for it in the vector database. After that, if the question of the user is specific, read one or more notes (the output includes the path to the note) and answer the question.

Use the `mdvector search` command to search for notes in a vector database
and get similar notes to a query with a similarity score.

## Usage

Use uv to run the mdvector command.

Use the --with flag to specify the dependency:

```bash
uv run --with mdvector COMMAND
```

## mdvector search

```
mdvector search [-h] [--qdrant-url QDRANT_URL] [--collection COLLECTION]
                       [--model MODEL] [--limit LIMIT] [--verbose]
                       query [query ...]

positional arguments:
  query                 Search query text

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --qdrant-url QDRANT_URL
                        Qdrant server URL
  --collection COLLECTION
                        Qdrant collection name (default: notes)
  --model MODEL         Sentence-transformers model (default: google/embeddinggemma-300m)
  --limit, -n LIMIT     Number of results to return (default: 10)
  --verbose, -v         Enable verbose logging
```

The `QDRANT_URL` and `QDRANT_COLLECTION` should be configured already based on environment variables.

The output looks like this:

```
{id}. {note path} | score={score}
    {short note content}
```
